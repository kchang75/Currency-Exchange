# Currency-Exchange
The objective of this assignment is to create an application with more than one view, serialize objects to files,
and incorporate a web service within one or more of the application’s models. The application presents the
user a user interface to select one or more favorite currencies from a list of ISO 4217 currencies. The
currencies can then be paired to form an exchange rate pair such that the user can convert from a home and
foreign currency. The output from the conversion shall be rounded and formatted according to the rules of the
currency.

The name of the application is CurrencyExchange. The application should have a minimum of two views. The
first view provides the user with two subviews (UITableView, UIPickerView or similar) which facilitates
selecting a home and foreign currency. Provide a text field that takes in the numeric input of the home currency
to be converted to a selected foreign currency. Let the user select additional currencies from a second view.
The list of currencies, the user’s favorites, and the last used exchange rate should be stored and recalled
whenever the application is loaded.
